- **Tertiary**: C-suite executives requiring portfolio insights

### 1.4 Data Transformation Flow
```
Structured Data (CSV/Excel) → Validation → Parsing → Analysis → Visualization → Insights
```

### 1.5 Technology Stack Role
- **Next.js (React + Node.js)**: Primary full-stack framework for frontend and backend
- **Python FastAPI**: Optional microservice for computational analytics and ML models
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data storage and relational queries
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Seamless integration between JavaScript and Python services
